        <p> 
            As said many times before, with next year coming around the corner, 
            many have some minor plans for the summer,
            but we should look at next school year as well. 
            Hopefully next year, I pass my concurrent enrollment for Pre-calc and do well during my MUN conferences if we do go to them. 
            I want to (maybe) take a honors class for science or english to raise my GPA as well. I plan on getting all A's and just improving my general knowledge of the world.
            I want to keep up with world history so that I can understand the other problems in different countries and find ways to help.
