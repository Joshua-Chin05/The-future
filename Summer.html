        <p>
            With what I know I have to do over the summer, I kind of set up a schedule for what things I can/will do during what times.
             I know for certain I want to spend the last part of the summer studying pre-calc in preperation for CSM during the fall.
            Im hoping that over the summer this Corona Virus is gone (it most likely wont) so I could meet friends, but I will most likely have to
            meet them 6 feet apart.

            I am hoping that over the summer, some good movies come out, although that is unlikely, just so I have
            some entertainment to keep me busy with over the summer.

            Recently, I have been trying to learn blender,
            so I want to continue learning it over the summer because I think it will be a cool thing to learn. 
            In addition, it will help me if I ever need to visualize a project or something like that.
