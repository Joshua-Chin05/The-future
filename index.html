        <p> 
            With the last week of the school being just around the corner, 
            many kids like me, are extremely excited for what is to come next.
            I for one, am excited for this whole corona virus to end, so I can hopefully meet up with some friends
            I haven't seen in a while because of being in different schools. 
            I am also just excited for this quarantine to end because I can just be outside and don't have to wear a mask around all the time 
            because they are kind of uncomforatble after long periods of time.
        </p>

                I guess another thing I'm looking foward to is getting to try concurrent enrollment for the first time.
                I'm going to be taking Pre Calc at CSM around fall, so it is going to be interesting to see how this plays out 
                due to us either being an online class because of the quarantine or a standard class.

            Also I am just looking foward to being out of school and being able to wake up later. I think hanging out with family
            is going to be a fun time during the summer as well. It would be fun to just watch a movie or play some board games.
